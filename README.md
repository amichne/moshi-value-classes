## [Moshi](github.com/square/moshi) Value Class Adapter Factories

There has been a long-open [issue](https://github.com/square/moshi/issues/1170) for Moshi regarding the inability to use value classes and unsigned integers for serialization.

This is presented as a solution to both aspects of the issue.


See the [examples](./EXAMPLES.md) for reference on the current moshi behavior and the behavior after the addition of the proposed adapter factories.
